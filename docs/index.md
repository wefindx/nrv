# Turing data role codes

Turing data role codes indicate the role of data and instances within programs and data. The codes are grouped into six classes:

1. [VALUES]() (`100`–`199`: `RESOURCES`)
2. [TYPES]() (`200`–`299`: `CATEGORIES`)
3. [FUNCTIONS]() (`300`–`399`: `METHODS`)
4. [PROCESSES]() (`400`–`499`: `SYSTEMS`)
5. [OPERATIONS]() (`500`–`599`: `OPERATIONS`)
6. [VARIABLES]() (`600`–`699`: `LOCATIONS`)

TBD: To have "The below status codes are defined by section X of RFC Y. You can find an updated specification in RFC Z.", where X, Y, Z are specific.
